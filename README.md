<h1> Cart Rider</h1> 
<p> Cart Rider is a game where you can resize the car and collect bananas and hearts. Its really cool because you get to control where the car goes. When you collect the heart your health goes up by 2 points and when you collect the banana your health goes down by 2 points. The background is really cool because it is a gif that shows the point of view thatd your really driving the car. Also the hearts and banana will randomly move down the screen. </p>
